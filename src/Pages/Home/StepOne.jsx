        <p className='pt-3' style={{fontSize:'15px',fontWeight:'400',fontFamily:'raleway'}}>This includes ensuring that women have equal access to education, employment, healthcare, and political representation, among others. </p>
        <p className='pt-3' style={{fontSize:'15px',fontWeight:'400',fontFamily:'raleway'}}>The fight for women's rights has a long and complex history, characterized by various social, economic, and political movements. While progress has been made in some areas, such as increased access to education and employment opportunities, women still face significant challenges globally, including gender-based violence, unequal pay, and limited political representation. It is crucial to continue to work toward <span style={{color:'#0096FF'}}><a target="_blank" href="https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/gender-equality#:~:text=Gender%20equality%2C%20besides%20being%20a,spurs%20productivity%20and%20economic%20growth.">gender equality </a></span> to ensure that women's rights are respected, protected, and fulfilled in every society. From the UN Human Rights report, violence against women is linked to  <span style={{fontWeight:'600',fontSize:'15px'}}>absolute poverty, illiteracy and armed conflict. </span></p>
        <p className='pt-3' style={{fontSize:'15px',fontWeight:'400',fontFamily:'raleway'}}>In several countries norms and values had been established to protect women; however, they had not been satisfactorily implemented. Implementation was costly and required adequate resources. BloomsGirl is a platform to create awareness amongst mass people to ensure women's rights as human being girls share their life experience of how she overcomes all obstacles, and social superstition and share their knowledge, and experience about career and life with other girls.</p>
